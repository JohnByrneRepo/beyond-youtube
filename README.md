Built on the bootstrap code from: https://github.com/angular/universal-starter

This repo demonstrates the use of 2 different forms of Server Side Rendering.

**Prerender(prerender)** 
* Happens at build time
* Renders your application and replaces the dist index.html with a version rendered at the route `/`.

**Server-Side Rendering(ssr)**
* Happens at runtime
* Uses `ngExpressEngine` to render you application on the fly at the requested url.

### Installation
* `npm install` or `yarn`

### Development (Client-side only rendering)
* run `npm run start` which will start `ng serve`

### Production (also for testing SSR/Pre-rendering locally)
**`npm run build:ssr && npm run serve:ssr`** - Compiles your application and spins up a Node Express to serve your Universal application on `http://localhost:4000`.

**`npm run build:prerender && npm run serve:prerender`** - Compiles your application and prerenders your applications files, spinning up a demo http-server so you can view it on `http://localhost:8080`
**Note**: To deploy your static site to a static hosting platform you will have to deploy the `dist/browser` folder, rather than the usual `dist`

## Universal "Gotchas"

> When building Universal components in Angular there are a few things to keep in mind.

- For the server bundle you may need to include your 3rd party module into `nodeExternals` whitelist

- **`window`**, **`document`**, **`navigator`**, and other browser types - _do not exist on the server_ - so using them, or any library that uses them (jQuery for example) will not work. You do have some options, if you truly need some of this functionality:
    
- If you need to use them, consider limiting them to only your client and wrapping them situationally. You can use the Object injected using the PLATFORM_ID token to check whether the current platform is browser or server. 
    
```typescript
 import { PLATFORM_ID } from '@angular/core';
 import { isPlatformBrowser, isPlatformServer } from '@angular/common';
 
 constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object) { ... }
 
 ngOnInit() {
   if (isPlatformBrowser(this.platformId)) {
      // Client only code.
      ...
   }
   if (isPlatformServer(this.platformId)) {
     // Server only code.
     ...
   }
 }
```
